# Module 4 - Uniquitous Connectivity - Database

## Overview

In this module, you will create the implementation of the Product API that will process requests to a relational database.

You will use Anypoint Studio to create a Mule application where there will be one flow for each method on each resource (i.e. GET products). Additionally you will use APIKit (as part of your Mule application) to process REST requests and transform them to messages to be handled and processed by each flow. You will connect each flow to a relational database and then test the API.
