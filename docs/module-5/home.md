# Module 5 - Salesforce Integration

In this module, we will create the implementation of our Customer System API that will provide a REST interface to the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The Customer API will use Salesforce â€‹as the system of record and each customer will be represented as a Salesforce Account.

The Module is separated in three different labs.
