# Lab 4: (Optional) Explore Exchange for Complete System, Process and Experience APIs
{: .no_toc }

## Overview

Let’s briefly explore Anypoint Exchange and look at some of the assets that were used within the Omni Channel API.

Anypoint Exchange is a discovery interface (UI and API) where you can find Anypoint Connectors, Templates, Examples, APIs, API Fragments and custom assets that help make the adoption of the Anypoint Platform easier and faster for you and your teams.

Anypoint Exchange provides publicly official MuleSoft content that you can access using Anypoint Studio or from the MuleSoft website as soon as it is published. You can also publish private content to it through your Anypoint Platform organization that is shared only among the members of your organization.

## Step 1: Open Anypoint Exchange

1. Go to [Anypoint Platform](http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/)

## Summary
As you’ve already experienced, Anypoint Exchange should be your initial starting point for just about any project. If you are looking to reuse an API then Anypoint Exchange is obviously where you should start. But even if you are creating a new API to be reused by others, it makes sense to first look in Exchange to see if the API already exists. Sometimes you will find that someone else has already undertaken the task of creating the API, or has created a subset of what you need.
